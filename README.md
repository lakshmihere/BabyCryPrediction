Deep Learning:  Baby Cry Prediction | Github | Streamlit App
-	Worked with Cappella, an early-stage MIT-founded startup building an AI-driven baby cry translator.
-	Data for baby cry translator-prediction app comes from donateacry-corpus by Gabor Veres.
-	Performed data exploration, data preprocessing, features scaling, features engineering using pandas, numpy, librosa(audio library) packages in python.
-	Librosa is an audio signal library in Python, and it was used to construct various spectrograms like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient, Chroma Energy Normalized, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Contrast, Spectral Rolloff, Zero Crossing Rate along with other audio features like tempo.
-	Exploratory analysis of the data revealed a class imbalance, and hence techniques for imbalanced data particularly SMOTE, i.e., oversampling the minority class was used to handle the class imbalance.
-	Built a multi class audio classification model with CNN in Keras Tensorflow to predict baby cry audio clips to translate in corresponding categories.
-	Achieved an accuracy of about 93 % using the model and proposed other deep learning methodologies for further improvement of the models along with the availability of more data not just in open-source platforms.
-	Created an AI powered app on Streamlit with the model created using deep learning technique for the purposes of demo.
-	Communicated the results of data collection, and requirements by interacting with other data sources and optimal strategy for taking best decisions.
-	Developed an interactive dashboard to present the current results and spearheaded the integration of new data sources into existing Power BI datasets.
-	Responsible for developing system models, prediction algorithms, solutions to prescriptive analytics problems and data mining techniques for the proposed business question.
Environment: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Librosa, Keras, Tensoflow, Streamlit, Scikit Learn Imblearn, Power BI, Tableau, Github.
